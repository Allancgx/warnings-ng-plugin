    Since the plugin shows the reported issues in a source code view, it needs to copy the affected files
    from the agent to the master. Otherwise these files could not be shown if the workspace has been deleted.
    If these files are not part of the workspace you can add an additional source code directory where the
    plugin tries to copy the files from. Note, that due to security restrictions these paths need to be registered
    in Jenkins system configuration before they can be used here.
